# Python Notes
Variable: A named location used to store data in the memory.
Data Type: Classification that specifies what kind of value a variable can hold (e.g., int, str, list).
Integer (int): Whole numbers, positive or negative (e.g., 5, -10).
Float (float): Numbers with a decimal point (e.g., 3.14, -0.001).
String (str): A sequence of characters, enclosed in quotes (e.g., "hello", 'Python').
Boolean (bool): Represents one of two values: True or False. Used for logic and comparison.
List: An ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items, enclosed in square brackets [].
Tuple: An ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collection of items, enclosed in parentheses ().
Dictionary (dict): An unordered collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces {}.
Set: An unordered collection of unique, immutable elements, enclosed in curly braces {}.
Operator: Symbols that perform operations on values and variables (e.g., +, -, ==).
Function: A block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Defined using the def keyword.
Method: A function that belongs to an object (often used with data types like strings and lists).
Module: A file containing Python definitions and statements (.py file). Used to organize code.
Library / Package: A collection of related modules.
Conditional Statement: Code that executes based on whether a condition is true or false (e.g., if, elif, else).
Loop: Code that repeatedly executes a block of statements (e.g., for, while).
Indentation: The whitespace used to define code blocks (e.g., under if statements or function definitions). Mandatory in Python.
Syntax: The set of rules that defines how a Python program must be written.
Comment: Non-executable text in code, used for explanation. Starts with the # symbol.
Keyword: Reserved words in Python that have special meanings (e.g., if, for, def, return).
Class: A blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and behavior (member methods).
Object: An instance of a class.
Import: Statement used to bring code from one module into another program.
Exception: An event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions (e.g., TypeError, ValueError).
Mutable: Can be changed after creation (e.g., list, dict).
Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation (e.g., str, int, tuple).
String Slicing: extract a portion of a string or work with only a specific part of it. Here's the basic syntax: str[start:stop]
